# Food For Your Mood

**Food For Your Mood** is a project that I am creating as a student doing a Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly.

This is an app which allows a use to select a mood and be given a random recipe based on their mood.

## How it works:
* Users select a mood from a drop-down. This mood is used as a search term in a database of food items, with a random food choice displayed and selected. 

* That random food choice is used as a search term in an API (www.spoonacular.com). An additional random choice from the API is then displayed with a title, image, time to make the dish, list of ingredients and number of serves.

* Users are able to create accounts, and logged-in users have the ability to add new foods to the database.

## Future enhancements:
* Recipe output page will be created.
* Registered users will be able to save their favourite recipes to their profile.

## Technologies used:
* Flask
* Postgres
* Spoonacular API (www.spoonacular.html)
